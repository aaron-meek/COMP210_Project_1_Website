                <h3>Welcome To My Website</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Though this is not my first website, it the first where I discuss several concepts, terms, and trends pertaining to computers and the digital world.</p>
                <p>Many wonder about the digital world, how it may influence them, and how they may influence it in return. All sorts of general and specialized electronic devices came into existence in such a short period of time. What might the purpose of these devices be, and for whome are they intended? Consumers? Creators? Professionals?</p>
                <p>The answers are <b>everything, and everyone</b>.</b></p>
                <p>Seriously, close your eyes, spin around, stop, and point your finger in a random direction. Then open your eyes. Chances are that whatever your pointing at has something to do with computers.</p>
                <p>Civil Engineers use software like <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">MATLAB</a> to simulate stress and strain patters through structures. This ensures that the structures are safe for public use under potentially dangerous conditions.</p>
                <p>Doctors use machines like <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri#:~:text=MRI%20is%20a%20type%20of,bones%2C%20muscles%20and%20blood%20vessels.">MRIs</a> to analyze and quantify anatomical and biological phenomina in their patients. This is to inform unsuspecting people of potential health issues they may face.</p>
                <p>Project Managers use software such as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/p/project-standard-2021/cfq7ttc0hh09?source=googleshopping&ef_id=_k_CjwKCAiA1-6sBhAoEiwArqlGPtuywOgwL6dpDFloVnXAGtI9DJG9klw3T9pNTO8gmTJIIXK0vYzolRoCV7kQAvD_BwE_k_&OCID=AIDcmmtj19x5qm_SEM__k_CjwKCAiA1-6sBhAoEiwArqlGPtuywOgwL6dpDFloVnXAGtI9DJG9klw3T9pNTO8gmTJIIXK0vYzolRoCV7kQAvD_BwE_k_&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA1-6sBhAoEiwArqlGPtuywOgwL6dpDFloVnXAGtI9DJG9klw3T9pNTO8gmTJIIXK0vYzolRoCV7kQAvD_BwE&activetab=pivot:overviewtab">MS Project</a> to organize and manage large scale projects, such as ones involving construction. Project management software can aid in organizing dates, cost, risk, and resources.</p>
                <p>Computers can interface with <a href="https://core-sensors.com/wastewater-pressure-transducers/">sensors</a> and be programmed to perform tasks on their own, like monitor pressure levels in pipes. This is an example of automation.</p>
                
                <p>Digital electronics, as a whole, may have had the greatest impact in our abiligy to learn and communicate as one massive intigrated society. One of my favourite parts to all of this is that these are all concepts and techniques I've learned through the aid of computers. Speaking of computer aids, Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) is another greate example of computers simplifying complicated tasks. But, computer aid doesn't stop there, it's also helped a lot of people, including myself, who face challenges that hinder their ability to learn certain subjects and perform certain tasks.</p>

                <p>Text-to-speach software aids those who have impaired eyesight. Speach recognition enables those with physical impairments to interact with computers. Those who may have never dreamed to comunicate their feelings finally have the technology to do so.</p>

                <p>I've already learned a lot through my time in college, and university. I've learned a lot from my former jobs, working in laboratories and construction sites. The best part is that there's always more to learn.</p>
