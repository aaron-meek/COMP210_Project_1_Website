                <h3>Concepts</h3>
                <p>To better unserstand how computers may impact us on a daily basis, it helps to discuss several important concepts.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Computers in education</h4>
                <p>In the beggnining, professionals were tained to perform tasks that required intense focus and an analytical mind. As computers entered the workplace, not long after was it that the next generation would be taught how to use them in school. Computers had such a large impact on how businesses organized data, and performed analysis, that it ended up creating a multitude of new jobs that required varying levels of skill. This meant new jobs for all sorts of people.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Computers on the job</h4>
                <p>Before computers were introduced into our world, certain tasks like complex calculations were performed by hand, with the aid of tables and basic mechanical devices. Engineering drawings were, literally drawings done by engineers. Today, we are provided with many electronic devices that both simplify and speed up the process. This both increase the number of jobs available, and reduced it. Engineers could now hire drafting technitions who are tained in using drafting software to create engineering draings, and large calculations could quickly be handled by the machines themselves. As a whole, we've created all sorts of computing and data centers that enable us to interact with the world, and complete large scale projects that were once unfeasible. This had a compounding effect, as the better we became at measuring, analyzing, organizing, and storting things, the better we became at pushing the limits of our current technology at any given time.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Data and informaiton</h4>
                <p>New ideas are often build on top of old ones. Scientific theories get revisions when new technology becomes availble to perform tests. Doctors need better methods for sorting and recalling patient information. The amount of new data generated on anygiven day is more than this world has ever been able to process and handle in and previous era. With efficient computers, data centers, and networks, the world of computing opened up to far more people than ever before. Smaller businesses could use cloud storage and cloud computing to get the infrustructer and computational power needed to meet larger business demands, all without sectioning out a whole new office space.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Personal computers</h4>
                <p>With all this new information an technology, we have many more learning oprotunities, and methods for completing complex tasks. Personal computers allow you to work and learn from the comfort of your own home. Computers also enable escential workers, such as health care professinals, to connect with their clients in higher frequencies, wherever they are.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Computer networks and the internet</h4>
                <p>The on thing that ties everything together. Nothing has made the world as large as it is today like that global network and the internet. It used to be that you were required to purchase a plane ticket to catch up with family members, or travel for work. Now, we have conference rooms for business communication. Family members can video all, and teachers can give lectures over the internet. Students can log onto their institutions accounts to find all there assignments, and schedule meetings with their instructors. Large software can be used over the internet now, instead of having to download it. To the majority of us, we have a translator available to us pretty much verywhere we go.</p>
