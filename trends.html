                <h3>Trends</h3>
                <p>There are some trends that you may have already noticed. Lets learn about a few, here.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Tiny Pc's</h4>
                <p>Before digital calculators were a thing, common tools for making advanced computations efficiently were through means of slide rules, mechanical calculators, and tables of precalculated values. Not only did digital calculators make computation more efficient, but it also simplified the process as well. Calculators, dictionaries, personal AI assistants, cameras, all in our pocket. This means, no matter your location, the sorts of problems we are able to solve independently with the aid of our electronic divices has increased sumstantially.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Self-Healing Devices</h4>
                <p>As we continue to produce new technology, we also continue to find new ways to reduce the polution due to the obsolecense of these devices through time. While some issues such as proprietary adapters are addressed as well, a large issue we face as a whole is the resulting polution through natural wear and tear of the things we use on a saily basis. As technology advanced, we were able to reduce the number of moving components in hard drives, and many other techniques were employed with the goal of reducing the speed of natural wear and tear. One speific question, however, pertains to the ability for devices to self heal. This would even further reduce the total polution, but by how much is stiil up in the air. For the majority of components in a digital device, the term "self healing" is ill-defined, or simply does not apply.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Power to Go</h4>
                <p>As we began our electromechanical endevours, much of what was being produced was held back by certain limitaions. The idea of a transister spawned from a vaccuum tube, and scientific breakthroughs such as quantum mechanics brought us there. However, removing the requirement of being plugged into a wall socket meant reducing the amount of energy drawn from the device. Thid in turn meant reducing the number of moving components, the size of each the compontent, all while maintaining the effeciency of the comonents. Today, not only do we have mobile devices far more powerful than the super computers 40 years ago, but we also have portable batteries that deliver large amounts of power for long periods of time to even futher increase the time we have with our device away from a fixed power source. You can work, effectively anywhere. And it isn't just the energy barrier we've overcome, but we are also able to transfer large amounts of data wirelessly, too.</p>
