                    <p>Before the advent of the World Wide Web, identity theaft often required one to physically obtain another's proof of identity. Presently, the majority of people have some form of information stored on an external server. Your doctor's office holds the files of many people, each containing private information. Many of these same people have accounts with online businesses tied to their payment information, and the security of said account may depend on the private information found on a person's file. Bad actors often target these data centers (big or small) to obtain your data. They may proceed to sell the information, or use it directly. Modern technology has enabled these sorts of events to take place between multiple parties across the globe.
